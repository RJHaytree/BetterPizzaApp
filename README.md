# BetterPizzaApp
A better version of the pizza ordering app I created for my Unit 14 - Event Driven Programming assignment

### Includes:
  - Protection against SQL injection through the use of MySQL parameters
  - A better, less cluttered interface design
  - Saving the order to a MySQL database
  - Auto-generated MySQL tables on start-up
  - Configuration file support for database credentials and sql table names
